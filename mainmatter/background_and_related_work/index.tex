\chapter{Background and Related Work}\label{ch:background_and_related_work}
This chapter will introduce background knowledge, needed to understand the rest of the report. 
It will start with an introduction of modern graphics hardware, both in general but also going in detail with specific architectures.
Following this, we introduce the graphics pipeline, which is a conceptual model of graphics processing, used by graphics programmers. 
Then a brief history of graphics programming and the role of \glspl{API} herein is explained, followed by a discussion of the modern Direct3D 12 and Vukan \glspl{API}.
Finally, the work in this report is contextualized, by relating it to earlier endeavors in the field of graphics programming and \gls{GPGPU}.
