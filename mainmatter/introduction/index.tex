\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

Computers and applications are no longer the niche market it was in its early days, and from that comes a need for intuitive interfaces for users. 
Around the 1970s the first computers with \glspl{GUI} started to appear to improve the user experience.
But to develop these \glspl{GUI}, developers use a lot of time working with the graphics \glspl{API}.
Developers have used these APIs to create incredible things, such as realtime graphics seen in games on top of the more graphically demanding \glspl{GUI} in modern operating systems.

As hardware improves, so must the \gls{API} to better use the improvements.
Another function of the \gls{API} is to make it easier for the developers to use the hardware so improvement in that area is also interesting for the \gls{API} developers.
But there is limited research into how to evaluate this kind of improvement on \glspl{API}.
And even if the newer \glspl{API} supports operations that improve performance, if the feature is too hard to use most developers will ignore it.

With the release of the most recent graphics \glspl{API}; Vulkan and Direct3D 12, there has been a push towards a more low level API which gives the programmer more control over the graphics pipeline.
Much of the functionallity that was handled by the driver, is now handled by the application. 
This has some advantages which will be described in later sections. \todo{insert sections referencer.}
But the argument that lower levels of abstraction means better \glspl{API} would suggest that writing in binary or assembly would give the best \glspl{API}.

Therefore, we are instested in where the newer \glspl{API} decided to go low level, and what advantages and disadvantages that approach has both on performance and programability.
The aim is to generate insight into the graphics \glspl{API}; Direct3D 12 and Vulkan, and to generate tools for future developers that can be used to evaluate and improve their \glspl{API}.

The reason why Direct3D 12 and Vulkan was decided upon was because they are released close to eachother (2015 and 2016 respecively), and have some overlapping ideas on how to improve graphics \glspl{API}, such as better thread support.
The predesessors to these \glspl{API} (Direct3D 11 and OpenGL 4.5) are some of the most broadly used graphics \glspl{API} for realtime rendering, and we suspect that Direct3D 12 and Vulkan will have similar success.
