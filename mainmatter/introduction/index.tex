\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
In the early days of consumer electronics, computer visuals were mainly displayed as text.
Yet, with the combined rise of microcomputers and \glspl{GUI} in the 80's, graphics and visuals became a hot topic for both developers and consumers.  
In the 90's, highly parallel graphics hardware in the form of GPUs were introduced to render 3D models in real time.
This piece of hardware has become a stable in modern consumer computers, either as individual components or integrated the CPU.

%Computers and applications are no longer the niche market it was in its early days, and from that comes a need for intuitive interfaces for users. 
%Around the 1970s the first computers with \glspl{GUI} started to appear to improve the user experience.
To ease development of graphical applications, graphics \glspl{API} have been created. 
These allow developers to work with the GPU at a more abstract level, through an interface.
%But to develop these \glspl{GUI}, developers use a lot of time working with the graphics \glspl{API}.
Developers have used these \glspl{API} to create impressive applications, such as modern video games, which render graphics in real time at 60 frames per second, as well as the graphically demanding \glspl{GUI} of modern operating systems.

%As hardware improves, so must the \gls{API} to better use the improvements.
%Another function of the \gls{API} is to make it easier for the developers to use the hardware so improvement in that area is also interesting for the \gls{API} developers.
Graphics \gls{API} have to evolve alongside the modern CPU and GPU architectures, to take advantage of new features. 
Yet, academic research into the evaluation of \glspl{API} and how to improve them is limited.
Even if the newer \glspl{API} supports operations that improve performance, if the feature is too hard to use most developers will ignore it.

With the release of the most recent graphics \glspl{API}; Vulkan and Direct3D 12, there has been a push towards a more low level API design, which gives the programmer more control over the graphics pipeline.
Much of the functionallity that was previously handled by the driver, is now handled by application developers. 
This has some advantages, which will be described in later sections. \todo{insert sections referencer.}
But the argument that lower levels of abstraction means better \glspl{API} would suggest that writing in binary or assembly would give the best \glspl{API}.

In this report, we are instested in how the newer \glspl{API} lower their abstraction-level, and what advantages and disadvantages that approach has both on performance and programability.
The aim is to generate insight into the graphics \glspl{API}; Direct3D 12 and Vulkan, and to generate tools for future developers that can be used to evaluate and improve their \glspl{API}.

Direct3D 12 and Vulkan are chosen, because they are released close to eachother (2015 and 2016 respecively), and have some overlapping ideas on how to improve graphics \glspl{API}, such as better multithread support on the CPU.
The predesessors to these \glspl{API} (Direct3D 11 and OpenGL 4.5) are some of the most broadly used graphics \glspl{API} for realtime rendering, and we suspect that Direct3D 12 and Vulkan will have similar success.
