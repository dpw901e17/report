Modern graphics APIs, Vulkan & Direct3D 12, are becoming more low level as to get around driver overhead. 
We suspect that this risks sacrificing programmability for raw graphics performance. 
To look into this, we will compare the APIs on performance and programmability. 
This comparison should give us an insight into modern APIs as well as lay the groundwork for a new API, which builds on top of either Direct3D 12 or Vulkan.

This leads to the following problem statements this project will attempt to solve:

How does Direct3D 12 and Vulkan compare on Performance and Programmability?

How does Direct3D 12 and Vulcan try to improve on graphics processing, and are they succeeding?

Where are they different and why?

Where are their improvements similar? 

How does the similar parts of the APIs compare to each other?

(How would it be possible to abstract DX12/Vulkan to a higher level?)
