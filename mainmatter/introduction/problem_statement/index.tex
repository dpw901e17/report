\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem_statement}
\begin{sectionmeta}
We recollect and examine the evidence presented in the previous sections.
That evidence is then used to define an area of interest, which the rest of the report is going to be about.
\end{sectionmeta}

\todo[inline]{Summarize evidence from the previous sections.}

\begin{problemstatement}
	Modern graphics APIs, Vulkan & Direct3D 12, are becoming more low level as to get around driver overhead.
	We suspect that this risks sacrificing programmability for graphic performance. 
	To look into this, we will compare the APIs on performance and programmability.
	This comparison should give us an insight into modern APIs as well as lay the groundwork for a new API, which builds on top of either Direct3D 12 or Vulkan.
\end{problemstatement}

\todo[inline]{Transition from problem statement to strategy}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How do Direct3D 12 and Vulkan compare on Performance and Programmability?
	\item How does Direct3D 12 and Vulcan try to improve on graphics processing, and are they succeeding?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Where are they different and why?
		\item Where are their improvements similar? 
		How does the similar parts of the APIs compare to each other?
	\end{itemize}
	%\item (How would it be possible to abstract DX12/Vulkan to a higher level?)
\end{itemize}
