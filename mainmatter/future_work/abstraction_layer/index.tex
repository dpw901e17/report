Based on the test results in terms of programability it was concluded that both Direct3D12 and Vulkan are difficult \glspl{API} to work with due to due the added complexity compared to their predecessors.

One way to further this project could be in attempting to create an \gls{API} based on either Direct3D12 or Vulkan which abstracts some of the features away in order to make it easier to use. Once the custom \gls{API} is fully developed it could be compared with the \gls{API} it was based on, and also the \gls{API} predecessor. 

Furthermore, as of writing this there do exist opensource projects based on Vulkan and Direct3D12 which also attempts to do the same thing. It would be sensible to look into these \glspl{API} and also compare these \glspl{API} with the custom \gls{API}.

As of writing this, we managed to find these opensource Vulkan and Direct3D12 \glspl{API}: 

VulkanSharp, Vulkan for C\# https://github.com/CloneDeath/VulkanSharp 
SharpVK, Vulkan for C\#. https://github.com/FacticiusVir/SharpVk 
VulkanCore, Vulkan for the .Net platform https://github.com/discosultan/VulkanCore 
LWJGL, Vulkan (But has support for OpenGL aswell) for Java https://www.lwjgl.org/ 
BGFX, a bunch of \glspl{API}(D3D12 wip, no Vulkan) support for a bunch of programming languages. https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx
